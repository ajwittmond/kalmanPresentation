# kalmanPresentation

This is a simulation and presentation about the Kalman-Bucy filter and the Extended Kalman-Bucy Filter.
The simulation is of taking noisy radar measurements of an object orbitting the earth.  The parameters
can be adjusted in source/res/options.ini.  The build depends on gtk, the armadillo linear algebra library,
and boost.
